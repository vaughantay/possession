# possession
Engine code for [Possession](http://possessiongame.com/ "Possession"). For use with the [LÖVE](http://love2d.org/ "LÖVE") framework.

This is not a playable version of the game; it's missing all the content. This is provided mainly for modding reference, or for someone to use in updating the game to work on future systems if I'm dead.

That said, it is available for use under the MIT license if you want to use any of the code. I recommend you check out [Roguelove](https://github.com/vaughantay/roguelove "Roguelove") instead, though, which is a version of the code that will receive updates and features that Possession itself doesn't have.
