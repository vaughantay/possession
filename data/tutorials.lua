firstTurn=[[Welcome to Possession!

Right now, you're a ghost, and are extremely vulnerable. If anything manages to hit you even once, you'll be destroyed!
The first thing you need to do is possess a body.
There are many ways to do that:
Press the ']] .. keybindings.possess .. [[' key or click the Possession button on the left, or press the ']] .. keybindings.spell .. [[' key and select Possession from the list.

After doing any of those, select a creature or possessable object. You can do this by highlighting them with the mouse and clicking, or by using the movement keys or tab, then pressing enter.

You can also right-click on a creature or possessable object and select "Possession" from the drop down menu.]],

firstPossession=[[You are now inhabiting a body!

When you possess a creature, you gain access to its stats and special abilities. Some creatures might even ignore you or fight on your side when you're in a particular body.

To view the body's stats and abilities, as well as statistics of your current game, press the ']] .. keybindings.charScreen .. [[' key.
You can also see a list of creature abilities in the sidebar, or by pressing the ']] .. keybindings.spell .. [[' key.

Now that you're in a body, start exploring the level. You're looking for a stairway, which will take you to the next level.

firstFailure=[[You failed to possess that creature!

Each creature has a % chance of possession success you can see by mousing over them or selecting them in examine mode (press ']] .. keybindings.examine .. [[' to enter examine mode). The possession chance can be affected by various status conditions (for example: if it's asleep or hasn't noticed you, it'll be easier to possess). Each time you try and fail to possess a creature, you weaken its resistance, and make it easier to possess next time you try.
If you try to possess something and fail, it will be stunned, so it can't attack you. But be careful of any other nearby creatures! If they hit you even once, it's game over.

afterFirstPossession=[[Don't get too attached to this body; your stay here is only temporary.

While in a body, you can leave it and try to possess another creature in the same way you possessed this one. Be careful, though. Unless you're actually next to your target, when you try to possess a new body you will leave your current one, even if you fail.

When you leave a body, it will explode, creating a disgusting mess and damaging any creatures nearby. The more powerful the body is, the larger and more dangerous the explosion will be.
]],

lowHealth=[[Your body is low on health!

To heal, press the ']] .. keybindings.heal .. [[' key. This will heal your body, but reduce its maximum health.
Of course, you can also try and possess another, more healthy body, if you'd prefer.

If you do end up dying, don't worry too much. You'll become a ghost again, and you'll have to find a new body.
]],

secondPossession=[[You're getting the hang of this!

Jumping from body to body is both necessary and useful, but when you do, you'll temporarily be unable to possess anything else for a limited time, and your new body won't work as well while you adjust.
The more bodies you possess over the course of the game, the longer it'll take to adjust, and the longer it'll take to possess again.
]],

stairs=[[You found the stairs!

The goal of the game is to climb up 10 levels to reach the surface. Each level has a different set of creatures on it, and they get progressively more powerful (and harder to possess!) as you ascend.
You've found the stairs on this level. When you're ready to leave, head on up.

Although...it can't be THAT easy, can it?
]],

death=[[Oh no, you died! Condolences.

Luckily, you've already come back from the dead once, so you can just go ahead and start a new game. The levels are randomly generated each time, so you'll face a slightly different challenge each game!]]
